if you look at synthdepth_1_0000059 image which is taken from nyu_synth_test(folder containing nyu test dataset), finger which is closer to camera is more white which means the more white the pixel is
the more closer it is to camera
while in data_11 which is taken from the seen_synth_test directory(on which network was trained), the closer fingers are more black
which means the closer the pixel is the more black it is.
